# Neural-Network-Model-Using-Linear-Regression.
This project involves developing a neural network model that employs linear regression for predictions. The model initializes parameters and performs forward propagation to compute the predicted values. It also includes a cost function for evaluating the performance and an iterative training process to update the parameters and minimize the cost. The project demonstrates the application of this model to a toy dataset, showcasing its ability to predict values based on input features.
